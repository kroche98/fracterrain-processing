# Fracterrain

This is a simple procedural terrain generator written as the final project for my Chaos and Fractals course in Fall 2017. It needs to be run using Python mode in Processing.

## How to use

Run using Processing. Starting from a flat area, the terrain will be recursively displaced and then displayed. Click to generate a new terrain.
To produce a terrain with finer detail, increase the ```d``` parameter. To make the terrain smoother, decrease the ```r``` parameter.
